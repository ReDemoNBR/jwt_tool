## Image Variants
### \<version> | <version>-bullseye
This is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you probably want to use this one.
These images are based on Bullseye release of Debian.

### \<version>-alpine
This image is based on the popular [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) which is much smaller than most distribution base images (~5MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images in general.
